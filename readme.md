# Debugging PHP Applications with Xdebug

This screencast shows you how to debug a PHP application with Xdebug in both PHPStorm and Sublime.

To follow along you will need the following prerequisites:

* [Virtualbox](http://www.virtualbox.org)
* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com)
* [Vagrant::Hostsupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater)

You will also need [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
